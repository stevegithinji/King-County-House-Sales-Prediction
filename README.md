## Overview
Real estate developers are interested in identifying factors that influence the sale price of homes in King County, as well as developing models to predict the sale price of homes based on these factors. This information can be used to optimize the design and marketing of new properties, identify investment opportunities, and make data-driven decisions about the development and sale of properties. To predict the sale price of homes, developers can use various statistical and regression models. These models incorporate a wide range of features and variables, such as the square footage of living space in the home, the overall grade of the house related to the construction and design of the house, and the square footage of the lot.

By leveraging the data and analytics, real estate developers can make more informed decisions about the development and sale of properties, optimize their marketing strategies, and identify new investment opportunities. This can lead to more efficient and profitable operations, as well as better outcomes for buyers and sellers in the real estate market.
